				<h1>Power, Ruin, and Renewal</h1>
				<p>
					Buda Castle sits on a limestone ridge above the Danube, a stage on which Hungarian power has been
					displayed, contested, and reimagined for nearly eight centuries. What visitors see today is less a single
					palace than a palimpsest: medieval walls beneath Baroque masses, Renaissance fragments remembered in archives,
					and post-war modernist interventions wrapped in 21st-century debates about authenticity and national identity.
				</p>
				<p>
					This site explores three threads: a concise timeline of expansions and destructions; the political
					stakes of reconstruction after World War II; and current arguments about how (or whether) to "restore"
					lost façades.

				<h2>Why Buda Castle matters</h2>
				<p>
					From the 14th century royal court to Habsburg ceremony and socialist-era museums, the castle's functions
					have shifted with regimes. Each layer left design choices—courts and courtyards, axial approaches, domes,
					and parade stairs—that communicate power. War repeatedly interrupted that narrative: the 1686 siege after
					Ottoman rule, and again the devastating siege of 1944–45, when the hill became a fortress and the palace
					burned. Post-1945, architects confronted ruin: conserve fragments, reconstruct Baroque shells, or modernize?
