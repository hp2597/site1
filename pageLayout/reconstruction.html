				<h2>Reconstruction After Fire: What to Restore?</h2>
				<p>
					The 1944–45 siege left roofs collapsed and interiors burned. Post-war Hungary faced material scarcity, urgent
					cultural needs, and a charged question: should the palace be rebuilt as a courtly residence, a museum complex,
					or a modern symbol of a new political order? Architects and officials chose a hybrid path—stabilize the Baroque
					massing, simplify exteriors, and adapt interiors for public institutions.

				<h2>Positions</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Reconstructionists:</strong> Reinstate lost domes, cornices, and stairways to recover a coherent historic image.</li>
					<li><strong>Modernists:</strong> Keep scars visible; avoid pastiche; design contemporary insertions where fabric is lost.</li>
					<li><strong>Curators of layers:</strong> Embrace the site as a timeline—preserve legible fragments from multiple eras.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>What was done</h2>
				<p>
					Exteriors were rationalized: ornament reduced, profiles simplified, and some ceremonial interiors replaced by
					flexible museum spaces. This approach foregrounded public use over royal memory and created a readable,
					if austere, palace shell. The result is controversial: some see integrity, others see a thinning of character.
				</p>

				<h2>How to judge authenticity</h2>
				<p>
					Authenticity at Buda Castle is not only about material survival; it is also about honest narration.
					A faithful story may require preserving both splendor and loss. Measured reconstructions can clarify volumes
					and routes; equally, careful restraint can protect the evidence of catastrophe and change.

						<h3>Use vs. image</h3>
						<p>Post-war choices privileged public institutions and legibility over ornamental revival.</p>

					<div class="card">
						<h3>Layers matter</h3>
						<p>The castle is most honest when its medieval, Baroque, and modern layers are all legible.</p>

						<h3>Debate continues</h3>
						<p>New projects inevitably reopen the question: restore, reinterpret, or reveal?</p>
