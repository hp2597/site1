				<h2>Power, Ruin, and Renewal</h2>
				<p>
					Buda Castle sits on a limestone ridge above the Danube, a stage on which Hungarian power has been
					displayed, contested, and reimagined for nearly eight centuries. What visitors see today is less a single
					palace than a palimpsest: medieval walls beneath Baroque masses, Renaissance fragments remembered in archives,
					and post-war modernist interventions wrapped in 21st-century debates about authenticity and national identity.
				</p>
				<p>
					This site explores three threads: a concise timeline of expansions and destructions; the political
					stakes of reconstruction after World War II; and current arguments about how (or whether) to "restore"
					lost façades.

				<h2>Why Buda Castle matters</h2>
				<p>
					Buda Castle matters because it is one of the most significant cultural, political, and symbolic landmarks in Hungary, representing the layered history of the Hungarian
					nation. Its position on Castle Hill, overlooking the Danube and facing Pest, makes it a visible emblem of statehood, resilience, and identity. For centuries, the Castle
					served not only as a royal residence but also as a center of political administration, art, scholarship, and intellectual life. It has witnessed the rise and fall of
					empires, wars of liberation, occupations, and revolutions—each leaving marks on its architecture and meaning.
					
					Its significance is partly rooted in continuity. From the medieval fortresses of the Árpád dynasty to the Renaissance residency of King Matthias Corvinus, the Baroque
					rebuilding under the Habsburgs, and the 19th-century expansions of architect Alajos Hauszmann, Buda Castle evolved in parallel with Hungary’s shifting place in Europe. The
					Castle has never been a static monument; instead, it has continually been reshaped to reflect the ideals, aesthetics, and identities of those who ruled it. Because of this,
					it serves as a physical archive of Hungarian history—each stone, courtyard, and dome layered with memory, aspiration, and political narrative.
					
					The Castle also holds emotional significance. It is a symbol of survival. During the Siege of Budapest in 1944–45, the Castle became a battleground, suffering severe
					destruction. In the post-war socialist era, many of its damaged sections were not restored to their former grandeur but rebuilt with simplified designs that stripped away
					historical ornament. This loss became symbolic of broader cultural erasure under state ideology. The contemporary restoration efforts—particularly under the National
					Hauszmann Program—are therefore not merely architectural projects but acts of reclaiming cultural continuity, identity, and national dignity. They reflect a broader desire
					to reconnect present-day Hungary with its historical narrative and artistic legacy.
					
					For Hungarians today, Buda Castle represents shared heritage. It is a place for public memory, state ceremony, tourism, and everyday community use. It is also part of a
					living urban environment, integrated with parks, museums, libraries, promenades, and cultural events that foster civic belonging. The Castle is a space where history is
					encountered not only in textbooks but in daily experience—where the past remains visible, intimate, and tangible.
					
					Ultimately, Buda Castle matters because it is more than a building. It is a symbol of Hungary’s identity, resilience, and cultural inheritance—a reminder of what has
					endured, what has been lost, and what continues to be reimagined for future generations.
